  job but I was shy and conscious to speak English. But everything
  changed when I join here and met my teacher. She gave me more
  encouragement and confidence to speak English so I am truly greatful
  for her hardwork and I hope she continues to practice my English for my
  work as well as for my coming Eiken exam'

My friend recommended this school and I think I did a right decision to enroll here, because my every day class is fresh, exciting and challenging. My teacher is good not only at teaching but also taking care of her students. We love sharing ideas and also learn our own culture. Let's do more classes in the future. Thank you."
