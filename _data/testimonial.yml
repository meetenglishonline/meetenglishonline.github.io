    text: 'I&#39;m working at pharmaceutical company and English is important to my
  job but I was shy and conscious to speak English. But everything
  changed when I join here and met my teacher. She gave me more
  encouragement and confidence to speak English so I am truly greatful
  for her hardwork and I hope she continues to practice my English for my
  work as well as for my coming Eiken exam'
